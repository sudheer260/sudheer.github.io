        <h2 class="blog-title">THE CELIAC’S GUIDE TO NORTHERN INDIA</h2>
        <p class = blog-content>A huge part of my excitement over visiting Northern India was, of course, the food. Everyone I knew ranted and raved about dishes throughout the country, their eyes glazing over and slightly losing focus, minds reeling with memories of tastes and smells. From those who had visited Rajasthan, tales of vegetables coated in spices and crunchy street snacks grabbed wherever possible flowed freely. I imagined tiny corner stalls piled high with treats, fried on-the go. I wasn’t wrong. But as a celiac in Northern India, what could I eat? Here is my guide to gluten free Indian food, from my weeks in the country.</p>
        <p class = blog-content>Notwithstanding the fact that many Indian meals do have rice, Northern India’s tastes often skew toward wheat—more than I realized. While Punjab is referred to as the “breadbasket” of the country, during our time in Rajasthan we were showered with wheat add-ons to our meals, local breads such as chapatis and rotis for all. Well, except me.</p>

        <h2 class="blog-title">TRAVEL TO NORTHERN INDIA: THE GOOD, THE BAD, & THE UGLY</h2>
        <p class = blog-content>I’ve said this every time I have returned from travels, my cloud fixation reignited immediately upon landing. Light and airy, the clouds still had heft, their bottoms flat and tops puffed outward, tumbling layers of white. After the wide open skies of India and Bangkok, Montreal clouds appeared to hang by a thread, as though they would at any point come careening down, flattening me. Rationally, I knew that clouds don’t crash. But in the haze of jetlag, my face pressed to the window on the drive back to my parents’ place, I had my doubts.        </p>
        <p class = blog-content>Everyone notices something different upon a return to what is familiar. For me, clouds. For my mother, sitting in traffic on that drive back home, the quiet. No horns, no yelling, no whistles being blown and no cows, goats or camels in the road. Turning to stare out of the window, she smiled “I kinda miss the cows, though.”</p>
