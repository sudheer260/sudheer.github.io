        <p class = blog-content>If you’ve ever wanted to learn how to make bagels, you are in the right place! 
          his traditional bagel recipe includes all of the tips for making homemade bagels that taste authentic, 
          including refrigerating overnight, boiling, and baking. If you like regular ol’ plain bagels, 
          then you can just stop right here, but this recipe is a fantastic jumping-off point for all sorts of add-in and toppings ideas
          The Bread Baker’s Apprentice by Peter Reinhart was one of the very first cookbooks that I purchased, 
          and in it was this recipe. After trying my hand at a number of other bread recipes, I finally dug in 
          and tackled these. There are some special 
          ingredients and techniques, but we’re talking through everything below so you can create the most amazing,
           authentic-tasting bagels in your own kitchen.</p>

        <p class = blog-content>The ball had barely left Cortnee Vine’s right boot and Tony Gustavsson and Mel Andreatta were already losing their minds, celebrating a stunner of a goal that opened the floodgates. To be any manager and assistant on the bench five months out from a World Cup would surely feel fraught. But to be a manager and assistant under pressure, five months out from a World Cup which they are co-hosting, might do something altogether different to the levels of cortisol in one’s body.</p>
        <p class = blog-content>There were a lot of eyes on CommBank Stadium on Sunday night, scrutinising a rematch against Spain and wondering if the Matildas would confirm last June’s 7-0 loss was just an experimental anomaly. Searching for a sliver of evidence that there is reason to hope come late July, that Gustavsson’s at times worrying two-year tenure was finally closing in on its objective.</p>

          <h2 class="blog-title">Tapisserie</h2>
        <p> 
          Years ago, at a flea market in Paris I pickup up some old metal letters from a bakery in France that spelled out PATISSERIE. 
          Being a baker, of course I was thrilled (although still despondent that someone else snatched up the matching BOULANGERIE letters…) 
          and proudly displayed them on the shelf of my apartment. Since my apartment at the time was so small, shelf space was at a 
          super-premium. Yet I was happy to give a lot of it up to have those letters reminding me of my métier.

          When I lent my apartment to some visiting friends, I noticed the P and the T had been reversed, and it spelled TAPISSERIE. 
          I got a kick out of it and thought that was very clever. When a new bakery in Paris called Tapisserie from the team of a noted 
          restaurant, I figured it wasn’t a place to purchase a tapestry, but a clever – and original – place to get terrific desserts.
